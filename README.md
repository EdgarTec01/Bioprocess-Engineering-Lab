¡Hi friend!
The codes presented in this repository has academic purposes.
The codes were generated to analyze operational units through simulations.

Some topics covered in the repository are:
  a) Bioreactor simulation (detalied instructions, and interactive functions): analysis of bactch, fed-batch and continuous operation regimes
  b) Centrifuge: analysis of parameters desing
  c) Liquid-liquid extraction (separator): design parameters analysis
  d) Bead mill: analysis in batch and continuos operation

You can download the codes for free and use them in your courses to understand better the function of these operational units, and see the effect of changing key design parameters.

¡Good luck!
